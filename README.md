# SolidSample

This is my own copy of the Solid Sample from the course on Pluralsight, [SOLID Principles for C# Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-solid-principles).

The original start of the source can be found here:

- [SRP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/SRP-START) *This should be basically the same as master but with an older README*
